My dream is to be a scientific and technological worker.
I deeply understand that it is not easy to be a qualified scientific and technological worker.
There will be joy of success on the road of growth, but more frustration of failure;
There will be harvest happiness, but more is the hard work. 
But I have the courage and determination to deal with all this.
As far as I am concerned, I am eager to fly high and have greater development space in the future and a broader world to display my talents. 
I think, if you work hard, you will reap. 
In the future, there will be an infinite and perfect future. 
Different fields have different values and meanings.
In different posts and corners, there are wonderful stories about labor rewriting destiny and striving to achieve the future.
Every story of struggle boosts the Chinese dream and makes the motherland strong. 
In my opinion, there is nothing more exciting than linking personal dreams with the interests of the motherland, 
because there is nothing more exciting than the strength of the motherland, 
and nothing more exciting than the rise of the nation. 
If you want to live up to your youth, you can only work hand in hand and forge ahead!
Because the harder I work, the happier I am!
